# SeismicWaves.jl

2D and 3D acoustic seismic wave propagation for constant and variable density. Gradients with respect to a misfit function are computed using the adjoint method (also using checkpointing). 
Computations can be run in parallel mode on GPUs or threads thanks to the package [`ParallelStencil.jl`](https://github.com/omlins/ParallelStencil.jl).

Elastic wave propagation is work in progress.
